            summary: "When moving a bill at breakneck speed, one law that cannot be repealed is the law of unintended consequences, as corporate tax provisions may prove.",
            body: "\"Slow down\" is the last thing that supporters of the Republicans\' proposed tax overhaul want to hear. \"My donors are basically saying get it done or don’t ever call me again,\" Chris Collins, a representative from New York, said last week.\n\nBut the rush to \"get it done\" — particularly on the business side, where the most sweeping changes are planned — is alarming tax specialists who warn that new and unforeseen complexity, loopholes and glitches could come back to haunt tax collectors and taxpayers.\n\n\"All of this is happening in an incredible rush, and frankly it’s absurd and incredibly poor governing to push a bill of this significance in the time frame they’re doing,\" said Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School who worked in the Treasury Department during the Reagan and Obama administrations.\n\nWith accountants, lawyers and lobbyists still poring over the varying versions of the bills released by the House of Representatives and the Senate, some of the loopholes and tax dodges spotted so far — whether unintended or not — include these:\n\n• A tax designed to prevent giant multinationals from shifting profits offshore also creates new opportunities for small and medium-sized firms to use tax havens to slice their tax rate in half.\n\n• A provision aimed at helping small business could turn into a windfall for wealthy investors who use it to lower their tax rate on rental and interest income.\n\n• An incentive to invest in slipshod, money-losing ventures would be created by the combination of a new proposal to immediate expense investments with the Senate’s suggested delay in the corporate tax cut.\n\n• Rules designed to prevent highly paid doctors, lawyers and other service providers from cashing in on new benefits aimed at small businesses can be easily circumvented.\n\nEven those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark.\n\nRepublican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.\n\nTax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures. And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.\n\nYet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.\n\nConsider the plan’s shift from a worldwide system, where profits are taxed no matter where they are earned, to a territorial system, which exempts profits earned outside the United States, brings the American tax system in line with those in most other nations.\n\nBecause the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.\n\nBut the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-sized businesses can limbo under. Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.\n\n\"They’re just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side,\" he said. \"And the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isn’t going to be able to check anything.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said, some safeguards aimed at multinationals could still be bypassed. To reduce their home tax bill, companies like Google and Pfizer, for instance, often relocate patents and copyrights in tax havens and then sell use of that intellectual property back to their American subsidiaries at eye-popping prices. These are the higher-than-normal profits — which Senate bill drafters have cunningly dubbed \"Gilti\" (for global intangible low-tax income) — that Republican bills are trying to stop from leaking out of tax system.\n\nMultinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.\n\nOther problems arise from the push to reduce the rate on pass-through businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate). Lawmakers have advertised the cut as relief for smaller businesses, but high-income investors in hedge and private-equity funds could use the provision to reduce the tax paid on rent and interest income by as much as a third.\n\nHedge-fund investors have an additional opportunity for a windfall with a simple reporting technique, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and former legislation counsel with Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. The funds’ decision to mark their trading positions at their market price (instead of their initial purchase price) would enable any gains to qualify for pass-through treatment at the newly reduced rate of 25 percent instead of being treated as short-term capital gains, at a top rate that nears 40 percent.\n\nThe pass-through changes present other tax dodges. Benefits for pass-throughs that provide services — like doctors, lawyers and accountants — are supposed to be phased out for individuals with incomes above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000. But a firm could skirt that limit by creating multiple partnerships with different functions, with one providing services, and the other handling, say, licensing or leasing, said Dan Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School who helped write the 1986 tax overhaul.\n\n\"There is not a single advantage this has, except for students of people like me, who will get paid more to figure out how to game the system,\" he said.\n\nIndividual proposals that might make sense on their own can also set off unintended consequences when paired together. Although the Senate plan to wait until 2019 to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent has infuriated some shareholders, it saves money so that Congress can reach its budget goals. Some tax experts go further and argue that any cut should be phased in over a 10 year period to smooth out investment and reduce windfall gains.\n\nYet enacting a 20 percent corporate tax rate to take effect one year in advance while allowing investors to immediately deduct their expenses at 35 percent operates like a subsidy, and could encourage investing in money-losing projects simply for a tax gain.\n\n\"That could lead to silly stuff where you have a loss before the tax, but a gain after the tax,\" Mr. Shaviro said.\n\n(He offered an example for the mathematically inclined. Normally no one would invest $100 to earn only $90 back. But under the Senate plan where some business expenses could be immediately deducted at a 35 percent rate, you would get $35 back in 2018. So your actual cost is $65. By the time your $90 earnings are paid in 2019, though, the tax rate would be 20 percent. That would cost you $18 in taxes, and leave $72 in your wallet. So even though your investment lost $10, you are still coming out ahead: with $72 on a net investment of $65.)\n\nOther experts pointed to constantly shifting cost estimates of proposals that suddenly gained or lost tens of billions of dollars overnight.\n\nAt the end of 10 years, the very safeguards that are supposed to prevent international tax avoidance actually lose money, according to the Joint Committee’s revenue estimates of the House bill, said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College. \"This is a big giveaway in future years,\" she said. \"On net, the whole system is ineffective.\"\n\nThe shortcomings are fixable to some degree, critics say, but the Republican strategy of pushing through a bill without Democratic votes before the end of the year — on tax rules that take effect a few weeks later — will not leave sufficient time.\n\nTo some supporters, though, that’s the price of success.\n\n\"Will they find things that need to be fixed afterwards because the process was moving so fast? Yes,\" said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel at the National Retail Federation, which represents big chains like Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue.\n\nBut there are always technical corrections to tax bills after they pass, Ms. Bernstein said, and retailers have been waiting so long for a corporate rate cut that they don’t mind if it finally happens with an imperfect bill.\n\n\"It’s part of how the sausage is made, but it’s better to make this sausage than cut it off,\" Ms. Bernstein said.",

            body: "FCC CHAIR AJIT Pai\'s plan to repeal net neutrality provisions and reclassify broadband providers from \"common carriers\" to \"information services\" is an unprecedented giveaway to big broadband providers and a danger to the internet. The move would mean the FCC would have almost no oversight authority over broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T.\n\nFor years, those broadband providers have used lawsuits and agency filings to fight FCC oversight and overturn its authority to prevent net neutrality abuses. But never in those companies\' most feverish dreams did they expect an FCC chair would propose to demolish all net neutrality protections and allow ISPs to extract tolls from every business in the country.\n\nEven industry analysts who expected the reclassification of broadband providers from Title II common carriers to Title I information services were stunned. Following Pai\'s announcement, independent cable analyst Craig Moffett sent out an email to investors entitled \"Shock and Awe and Net Neutrality,\" writing, \"We've known since the election that the FCC would reverse Title II. But we never expected this. Yesterday's FCC Draft Order on Net Neutrality went much further than we ever could've imagined in not only reversing Title II, but in dismantling virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.\"\n\nIf Congress allows Pai's plan to pass, all that will be left of FCC oversight of broadband providers is a weak disclosure requirement: If Verizon, for example, wants to block content, charge sites to be viewable on its network, or create paid fast lanes, the company will simply have to tell its subscribers in their contract's fine print. (Broadband providers won't have to disclose, and the FCC won't have control over, the sneakier ways they\'ve found to mess with the internet.)\n\nEnforcement will be left to the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that\'s never enforced open internet rules and has no ability to formulate its own. The FTC won\'t even be able to protect consumers against most net neutrality violations after the fact, and nor will it be able to protect consumers against greedy broadband providers.\n\nNon-mainstream media news sources across the political spectrum would no longer be able to afford to compete in the marketplace of ideas. Even churches that now reach their members online with streaming sermons, video libraries, and online video chats, would no longer be protected from blocking or access fees.\n\nAnd while the FCC held multiple public hearings with participation from experts during previous net neutrality actions in 2008, 2010, and 2015, this time around, Pai didn\'t hold a single one.\n\nThe only crisis looming is the one that Pai\'s plan will create for entrepreneurs, free markets, free speech, and for Republican members of Congress running for re-election who didn't make the choice to stop Pai when they had the chance.\n\n/",

She also described Markle\'s mother as \"a dreadlocked African-American lady from the wrong side of the tracks.\"\n\nThe Spectator magazine this week questioned the \"Suits\" star\'s suitability for Prince Harry because she is divorced and attended a Catholic school.\n\n\"Obviously, 70 years ago, Meghan Markle would have been the kind of woman the prince would have had for a mistress, not a wife,\" a comment piece read.\n\nHarry last year took the highly unusual step of asking the media to stop the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" against Markle.\n\n\"You're always setting up yourself for a bit of fall when you put expectations on one person of color, or woman of color, and expect them to be the redemption you've be waiting for,\" Akpan said.",

            summary: "Concerns grow for operatives probing working conditions at Huajian facility manufacturing footwear for President\'s daughter\'s fashion line", body: "A labour activist researching working conditions in a Chinese factory that makes shoes for Ivanka Trump's label has been detained by police, according to his wife and a labour advocacy group, while two others have gone missing and are presumed also to have been detained. The three activists were investigating labour conditions at Huajian shoe factories for China Labor Watch, a New York-based non-profit organisation that aims to defend workers' rights. Huajian has previously said it has been making shoes for the US President's daughter for nearly a decade, accounting for one-third of her shoes made in China but only a small proportion of its total output. But China Labor Watch said its investigation in working practices at Huajian factories has apparently been closed down by local police. The three activists were placed under investigation and told they were not allowed to leave China back in April, said Li Qiang, CLW's founder - something, he said, was relatively common. Factory used by Ivanka Trump’s brand accused of violating labour laws. But they now all appear to have been detained, he said, something he said was very rare. \"This never happened before in my 17 years' experience, this is the first time,\" he said. \"The only reason we think this case is different is that this is Ivanka Trump's factory.\"White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks referred questions to Ivanka Trump's company, which declined to comment. Huajian did not immediately respond. Marc Fisher Footwear, which manufactures Ivanka Trump shoes but does not own these facilities, said: \"We were unaware of the allegations, this arrest and will look into them immediately.\" Activists Hua Haifeng and Li Zhao had been investigating reports that the Huajian factories in Ganzhou city in Jiangxi province used student labor, while a third activist, Su Heng, was working undercover inside the factory, CLW's Li said. Hua's wife Deng Guilian said she had not spoken to her husband since Sunday. But she said she had received a phone call from the Public Security Bureau in Ganzhou on Monday saying he had been detained on suspicion of \"illegal monitoring.\" Police declined to give further details, she said. Li said Hua had been accused of using \"eavesdropping equipment.\" The other two activists are also unreachable, he said. China Labor Watch has carried out frequent investigations into labor violations in Chinese factories making anything from Disney toys to Apple iPhones. In May it issued an interim report on working conditions at Huajian's factories, citing long hours and low pay among others issues. The group said it had written a letter to the first daughter detailing the allegations in late April, but had yet to receive a reply. In that report, it alleged that employees are forced to work at least 12½ hours a day and at least six days a week - at a monthly salary of about 2,500 yuan ($365). It said pay for some workers amounted to the equivalent of less than a dollar an hour. Li said his investigators had documented long working days, the longest stretching 18 hours from 7.10am to 1.30am next day. In January, Liu Shiyuan, then spokesman for the Huajian Group, told the Associated Press the company makes 10,000 to 20,000 pairs of shoes a year for Ivanka Trump's brand - a fraction of the 20 million pairs the company produces a year. This is not the first time looking into Huajian's work for Ivanka Trump has reportedly led to problems for Chinese citizens. Last year, a team from the French news agency Agence France-Presse was given access to another Huaijian factory in the southern city of Dongguan. But the resulting coverage and photographs, some of which showed workers on assembly lines and living in dark dormitory buildings, apparently did not please the company's management. As a result, China's Global Times newspaper reported, some workers involved in the reporting and shooting of images had been fired. The Global Times blamed \"misreporting\" by Western media out to malign the reputation of the Trump family, and quoted the factory chairman as confirming the sackings, adding he preferred not to be identified by name. But a man who described himself as the head of public relations at the factory, but also did not give his name, emerged from the factory on a recent day to deny that anyone had been fired. The Global Times report also cited staff from two factories in Guangdong as saying that their companies had received a memo from Ivanka Trump's China-based agent shortly after the US department store Nordstrom dropped her products in February, notifying them that any media reports on her suppliers in China would not be good for her image due to political reasons.Hua's wife Deng said she believed her husband's job was \"helpful and meaningful to society.\" \"If he is sentenced for this, I can't accept it, I can't accept it's justice,\" she said by phone from her home in the central province of Hubei. She said she had not told her two young children, ages seven and three, who still think their father is working away from home. \"They always ask to video chat with their father. I have to say to them, 'Your father is very busy,' and tell them, 'He will talk to you when he's not busy.'\"",

            summary: "Federal regulators rolled back decades-old rules on Thursday, making it far easier for media outlets to be bought and sold.",
            body: "Federal regulators rolled back decades-old rules on Thursday, making it far easier for media outlets to be bought and sold — potentially leading to more newspapers, radio stations and television broadcasters being owned by a handful of companies.\n\n The regulations, eliminated in a 3-to-2 vote by the Federal Communications Commission, were first put in place in the 1970s to ensure that a diversity of voices and opinions could be heard on the air or in print. But now those rules represent a threat to small outlets that are struggling to survive in a vastly different media world, according to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. With the rise of blogs, websites and podcasts, Pai said, traditional media outlets now face more competition than ever — and rules that once enforced a diversity of viewpoints are no longer needed. \n\n \"Few of the FCC's rules are staler than our broadcast ownership regulations,\" Pai said. By eliminating them, he said, \"this agency finally drags its broadcast ownership rules to the digital age.\"\n\n One long-standing rule repealed Thursday prevented one company in a given media market from owning both a daily newspaper and a TV station. Another rule blocked TV stations in the same market from merging with each other if the combination would leave fewer than eight independently owned stations. The agency also took aim at rules restricting the number of TV and radio stations that any media company could simultaneously own in a single market. \n\n A major beneficiary of the deregulatory moves, analysts say, is Sinclair, a conservative broadcasting company that is seeking to buy up Tribune Media for $3.9 billion.\n\n \"This has a huge impact,\" said Andrew Schwartzman, an expert on media law at Georgetown University. He added that the decisions will \"reduce or eliminate\" the need for Sinclair to sell off many stations to receive regulatory approval for the deal.\n\n The FCC vote is the latest to ease regulations for the broadcast industry. It came the same day that the agency approved the deployment of Next Gen TV, a new broadcast standard that is ultimately expected to lead to improved audio and video quality on over-the-air television, as well as targeted advertising. And it came one month after the FCC voted to no longer require broadcasters to operate a physical studio in the markets where they are licensed.\n\n The National Association of Broadcasters welcomed Thursday's vote.\n\n \"These rules are not only irrational in today’s media environment, but they have also weakened the newspaper industry, cost journalism jobs and forced local broadcast stations onto unequal footing with our national pay-TV and radio competitors,\" the trade group said in a statement.\n\n Critics of the FCC repeal effort say that the decision will lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a dwindling number of media titans.\n\n \"Instead of engaging in thoughtful reform,\" said Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, \"this agency sets its most basic values on fire. \"As a result of this decision, wherever you live, the FCC is giving the green light for a single company to own the newspaper and multiple television and radio stations in your community. I am hard pressed to see any commitment to diversity, localism, or competition in that result.\" Senate Democrats this week called on the FCC's inspector general to launch a probe of the agency, over concerns that its impartiality with respect to Sinclair had been \"tainted.\" \"This merger would never have been possible without a series of actions to overturn decades-long, settled legal precedent by Chairman Pai,\" Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and 14 other lawmakers wrote in a letter. The letter added that Pai has \"signaled his clear receptiveness to approving the Sinclair-Tribune transaction and in fact paved the way for its consummation.\" The FCC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Sinclair declined to comment. In his remarks Thursday, Pai said it was \"utter nonsense\" that his agency's decisions on media ownership would lead to a company dominating local media markets by buying up newspapers and radio stations. \"It will open the door to pro-competitive combinations that will strengthen local voices,\" he said, and \"better serve local communities.\"",

            summary: "The majority of Puerto Rico is still without power. Governor Rossello says his \"main focus is to restore the energy grid.\"",
            body: "The executive director of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority resigned Friday amid questions about the slow repairs more than eight weeks after Hurricane Maria destroyed much of the electrical grid. \n\n PREPA head Ricardo Ramos Rodríguez had come under close questioning about a $300 million contract the utility signed with the tiny Whitefish Energy firm instead of turning to larger, more experienced networks of utilities that traditionally rush to aid storm-ravaged areas. The Whitefish Energy contract, whose rates were substantially higher than those paid to others, was later canceled. \n\n Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announced the resignation, saying Ramos’s tenure in office had become \"unsustainable.\" \n\n \"The executive director is a professional. He has worked hard to restore the system in Puerto Rico but understands that this is a context that has greatly distracted from what could be recovery,\" Rosselló told reporters. \n\n The governor said that he was recommending that the PREPA board of directors name Justo González, a career employee who began his career with the authority in 1989, as interim director. During the news conference, the governor expressed frustration with the pace of power restoration to Puerto Rican households and businesses.\n\n \"We have faced a number of obstacles,\" Rosselló said. \"But I expect an effective transition.\" \n\n In recent weeks, Ramos had defended his decisions, saying that Whitefish had volunteered its services and had experience in rugged terrain like that in much of the commonwealth.\n\n The ability of PREPA to manage money and contracts has also drawn attention from Congress, which is worried about how billions of dollars of recovery money might be handled.\n\n Hours before tendering his resignation, Ramos appeared in a video on the PREPA Facebook page, explaining the cause of two major power outages this week that plunged large swaths of the San Juan metropolitan area back into darkness. The system has suffered a series of outages and weather challenges that have delayed the restoration of transmission and distribution lines\n\n Ramos also came under scrutiny after news outlet El Vocero reported that, during the post-hurricane emergency, Ramos had hired his friend Pedro Juan Morales-González, a lawyer and engineer. Rosselló said that contract would also be canceled.\n\n According to the local newspaper, El Vocero, Ramos hired the law firm of his friend Morales-González to work for PREPA. Morales-González’s name came up in the charging documents in the 2011 public corruption case of a former Puerto Rico senator alleging he sold a judicial seat. Morales-González was not charged with corruption. \n\n As the governor became aware of all this Friday morning, he ordered an investigation and canceled PREPA’s contract with the Morales-González law firm.\n\n Ramos addressed the newspaper’s story in the Facebook video saying that \"absolutely nothing was done outside the law\" with regards to the $100,000 legal services contract. He said the agency solicited bids to retain local law firms to assist with legal matters that may result from the employee layoffs at PREPA. The firm has not been paid a cent, Ramos said.\n\n The disarray at the top of PREPA dealt a new blow to Puerto Ricans, more than half of whom remain without electricity. The storm damage has imposed costly repair burdens on a utility that was already struggling with more than $9 billion in debt, poor service and sky-high rates more than twice the national average.\n\n Even before it was hit by hurricanes Irma and Maria, PREPA said it needed more than $4 billion to overhaul its outdated power plants and reduce its heavy reliance on imported oil.\n\n But the hurricanes have exposed transmission problems, too. PREPA has 2,478 miles of transmission lines from its power plants and 31,485 miles of distribution lines, which carry electricity shorter distances from the grid to customers.",

Parek told Yahoo Lifestyle he felt obligated as both an artist and a citizen to use photography to bring attention to the severity of the situation. \n\n \"The buzz or the alarm regarding pollution is raised only when the situation worsens; otherwise, no one talks about it,\" he said. Further, the clearly hazy photos were in no way retouched: The smog in the northern Indian territory is exactly as bad as it looks, Parek said. \n\n \"Usually we do lots of post-processing in our photos, but here I tried to keep them as natural as they are. I have not increased the highlights or clarity to look hazier,\" he added.\n\n With the toxic smog cited as \"truly a health emergency\" by Indian officials, one expert said that emergency hospital admissions have leapt by 20 percent as of late as people suffer heart and lung complications from the poor air quality. \n\n As a photographer, Parek says he’s well aware that these are not the kind of photos that newlyweds-to-be desire, but it’s likely that they are even more outraged with the current environmental emergency, too.",

            body: "The chief executive of Cambridge Analytica has confirmed that the UK data research firm contacted Julian Assange to ask WikiLeaks to share hacked emails related to Hillary Clinton at about the time it started working for the Trump campaign in summer 2016. \n\n Speaking at a digital conference in Lisbon, Alexander Nix said he had read a newspaper report about WikiLeaks’ threat to publish a trove of hacked Democratic party emails, and said he asked his aides to approach Assange in early June 2016 to ask \"if he might share that information with us\", according to remarks published by the Wall Street Journal. \n\n Assange, WikiLeaks’s founder, has already acknowledged the approach by Cambridge Analytica and said WikiLeaks rejected the request. In Lisbon, Nix reportedly agreed that the overture had been rebuffed. \n\n \"We received a message back from them that he didn’t want to and wasn’t able to, and that was the end of the story,\" Nix said at the Web Summit conference, according to the WSJ. He called the exchange \"very benign\". \n\n However, the contacts between Cambridge Analytica and WikiLeaks are of interest to investigators looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. The documents published by WikiLeaks in the summer of 2016 were later determined by US intelligence agencies to have been stolen by hackers working for Russian intelligence. \n\n According to the Journal, citing emails and unnamed sources, Cambridge Analytica had sent employees to the Trump digital campaign headquarters and was in the process of finalising a contract with the campaign in early June of last year, apparently around the time Nix said he made the approach to Assange. It is not suggested that Cambridge Analytica made the approach at the Trump campaign’s request. The Guardian has contacted Cambridge Analytica for comment. \n\n Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee looking into possible Trump-Moscow collusion has said the committee had a \"deep interest\" in the relationship between Cambridge Analytica and WikiLeaks. \n\n In an interview at the Web Summit, Nix rejected any suggestion of collusion with Russia. \n\n \"We did not work with Russia in this election, and moreover we would never work with a third-party state actor in another country’s campaign,\" he said.\n\n Robert Mercer, a Trump mega-donor, and his daughter, Rebekah, are major investors in Cambridge Analytica and Steve Bannon was a vice-president of the company before joining the Trump campaign and becoming the president’s chief strategist in the White House.\n\n Cambridge Analytica’s website promises to help clients gain advantage over political opponents with its data analysts of US voter behaviour. It claims to hold up to 5,000 pieces of data on more than 230 million voters, to build a \"psychographic\" profile of targeted voters.\n\n The company was hired to become part of the digital campaign, which was overseen by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and was paid $5.9m, according to the Federal Election Commission.",

            summary: "As activists and lawmakers make strides in overhauling controversial money bail practices around the nation, a new report is helping the public to understand what successful reform looks like.",
            body: "As activists and lawmakers make strides in overhauling controversial money bail practices around the nation, a new report is helping the public to understand what successful reform looks like. \n\n The nonprofit Pretrial Justice Institute released its first state scorecard on Wednesday, grading all 50 states on their pretrial justice practices. The report issues a letter grade for each state based on its pretrial detention rate, its use of pretrial risk assessment and its reliance on payment as a condition for release before trial. \n\n \"We wanted to be able to take stock today and also have something to measure it by on an annual basis,\" said Cherise Fanno Burdeen, CEO of the Pretrial Justice Institute. \"Things are changing so quickly out in the field in terms of policy examination and potential change.\" \n\n Despite recent progress on pretrial justice reform, the nation as a whole gets a D grade, and only New Jersey gets an A. \n\n New Jersey’s 2014 bail reform law went into effect at the beginning of the year, largely eliminating the old monetary bail system. Pretrial services agencies now conduct individualized assessments based on a defendant’s flight risk and potential threat to community safety, and provide courts with release recommendations. Under the new system, money bail is used only as a last resort. The number of people awaiting trial in New Jersey jails dropped by 15 percent over the first six months of the year, and by more than one-third between mid-2015 and mid-2017. \n\n \"Crime is actually down 14 percent this year in New Jersey, with a 7 percent drop in violent crime,\" said Burdeen. \"We’re not saying those are correlated; I’m simply saying there’s also no correlation between pretrial release of appropriate people and some skyrocketing crime rate in New Jersey. \n\n The number of people awaiting trial in New Jersey jails dropped by 15 percent over the first six months of the year, and by more than one-third between mid-2015 and mid-2017. \n\n Across the U.S., many states and jurisdictions still rely on money bail, meaning most defendants ― including those facing only low-level charges ― must pay to get out of jail before trial. \n\n Those who can’t afford bail can be stuck in jail for weeks, months or longer just because they’re poor. Others turn to commercial bail bond agencies to secure their release. These businesses charge a nonrefundable service fee, usually 10 percent of the total bail amount, which means defendants or their friends and families can be left paying hefty fees, even if the charges are dropped or if the defendant is never found guilty of a crime. \n\n These practices contribute substantially to the U.S. problem of mass incarceration. There are nearly 450,000 people who have not been convicted of a crime in jails across the country. They make up nearly two-thirds of the jail population, and about 20 percent of the overall incarcerated population. Locking these people up costs U.S. taxpayers approximately $38 million every day, or $14 billion annually, according to a Pretrial Justice Institute report published earlier this year. \n\n Critics of money bail say it perpetuates an unconstitutional, two-tiered system of pretrial justice. It allows wealthy people to buy their freedom without any consideration of their flight risk or threat to safety, while poorer people are left to languish behind bars before any determination of guilt. Many poorer defendants choose to plead guilty just to get out of jail, regardless of whether they actually committed a crime.\n\n A number of states and jurisdictions have begun to reform their bail practices in recent years. A series of high-profile lawsuits have accelerated progress at the local level, successfully challenging so-called \"wealth-based pretrial detention\" and forcing judicial officers to reduce their reliance on money bail. Statewide legislative action to change bail practices is currently underway in California, Alaska and Connecticut. Other state court systems are exploring voluntary changes as well. \n\n Although the Pretrial Justice Institute gives poor grades to the majority of states, Burdeen says the report does carry some good news. One-quarter of people in the U.S. now live in jurisdictions that use evidence-based pretrial assessments to determine release, for example. And many state and local reforms are in the process of being implemented, which means their results may not show up in the data for another year or two. \n\n For the failing states, Burdeen said the purpose of the scorecard isn’t to shame, but rather to emphasize the urgent need for action. \n\n \"The fact that a state has a D or and F means that there are people living in those states under broken systems,\" said Burdeen. \"Those are real people who are sleeping in those jails tonight. We’d like to see these really bad grades start some much-needed discussions in those jurisdictions.\"",

            summary: "\"The program showed me I wasn’t the only person who had a parent who was in prison.\"",
            body: "When Dee Ann Newell began teaching parenting courses to mothers behind bars nearly 30 years ago, she kept hearing the same request: Please check on our kids. \n\n  \"Our children, they’re just barely hanging on,\" Newell remembers the women saying. \n\n When she visited those kids, what she found were families \"in great distress ― financially, emotionally and in so many other ways.\" Newell launched Arkansas Voices for the Children Left Behind in 1994. \n\n Over the years, she said, the nonprofit has offered some 38,000 vulnerable kids the comfort, support and opportunities they wouldn’t otherwise have had. But the funding hasn’t kept up with the need. \n\n Today, Arkansas has the fastest growing prison population in the United States. Many of these inmates are parents, including single parents, and they have left about 70,000 children growing up without a mom or dad. \n\n Children whose parents are behind bars struggle with feelings of isolation and shame. They’re at greater risk of developing depression, anxiety, and behavioral issues. \n\n \"You’re grieving someone who’s not dead, but for all intents and purposes, they’re not there,\" said Newell. \"There’s a lot of trauma.\" \n\n Arkansas Voices matches the children up with mentors and works closely with schools to keep the kids from falling behind. Poor grades and higher dropout rates are an ongoing problem. The fact that African-Americans are overrepresented in Arkansas’ prison population may even contribute to racial gaps in academic performance. To combat those feelings of isolation, Arkansas Voices brings the children together with other kids dealing with the same issues. \n\n \"The program showed me I wasn’t the only person who had a parent who was in prison,\" said Alexis Beavers, now 23. \"For a while, I thought I was the only person.\" \n\n The group also helps children maintain relationships with their imprisoned parents. It offers parenting classes to those incarcerated moms and dads. It runs support groups for grandparents, who are often left to care for the kids. And it works with families on the re-entry process if and when parents return home. \n\n Newell, who serves as executive director of Arkansas Voices, actively recruits for her programs. She visits schools and flat-out advertises that she’s looking to aid children who have a parent in prison. She said she also tries to hire people who themselves have been affected by incarceration and can truly understand the needs of the clients. \n\n She has helped at least 10 similar groups get off the ground, Newell said. She meets with their founders and shares her experience in running programs, finding staff and reaching out to children. \n\n Beavers was one of those kids who got help from Arkansas Voices when she most needed it. Her mother was sent to prison when Beavers was 4 years old and is currently serving a life sentence for capital murder and aggravated robbery in relation to two restaurant robberies ― although Beavers believes the charges were unfair. \n\n Raised by her grandparents, Beavers experienced the textbook consequences of having an incarcerated parent. She was quiet and anxious about socializing. She felt like people expected her to amount to nothing because of her mother’s record. She worried about other kids teasing her and she often claimed her mother was in the military to explain away her absence. \n\n At the root of it all was a deep fear that no one else could understand what she was going through. \n\n \"People have these judgments about me,\" Beavers said. \n\n Strangers often gush about how sorry they feel for her when they hear her mother’s story, she said. But when she tells new acquaintances how much she loves art or travel, she said she’s often met with disbelief. People wonder aloud how somebody with a parent in prison could possibly have such interests. \n\n It was Arkansas Voices that opened up her world when Beavers’ grandparents couldn’t afford to. She was 6 years old when she first got involved with the group. The guidance and activities that Arkansas Voices provided, as well as the regular visits with her mom it arranged, worked to ease the girl’s anxiety. \n\n \"It helped me not be so angry at the world,\" Beavers said. \"Growing up without a parent, you are angry. You see other people with their parents and think, ‘I wish I had that.’\" \"[Newell] gave us options,\" Beavers said. \"She showed us a different life outside of the life that we were living.\" \n\n Arkansas Voices has even helped to ease the trauma associated with visiting a parent in prison. Beavers, who said she now sees her mother about twice a month and talks with her on the phone once a week, has distinct memories as a child of going through metal detectors to spend a few hours in a dreary, colorless room with no games. \n\n These days, the nonprofit organizes \"family days\" at prisons, when kids and parents can get together in a designated room, eat pizza and sing songs. It’s a vast improvement over trying to bond in a stark room where children aren’t allowed to get up from their chairs, Newell said. \n\n Arkansas Voices still helps children across the state visit their parents in various prisons. Due to funding cuts, however, it has a smaller reach than it once did. At its height, the nonprofit had 10 locations around the state. Now it has just one, in Little Rock.\n\n Newell has managed to run a lean operation ― her home serves as the organization’s headquarters ― but she’s gravely concerned about money, she said. In the past, the group received significant funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, she said, but that has declined over the years and all but disappeared under the Trump administration. (HHS did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.) \n\n Newell remains optimistic about her nonprofit’s future though. She’s looking to the children she once supported to help carry on the mission. \n\n Beavers, who currently works as a cashier at a local hospital, is one of those budding leaders. She mentors other kids now and hopes to resume her studies at college soon. She wants to continue working with children forced to grow up with a parent in prison and to change the stigmatization they face. \n\n \"I wish people would understand I am not my parent. I’m not my mom, even though she didn’t commit a crime. I’m not her,\" Beavers said. \"I wish that people would just give me a chance.\"",

            body: " Representative John Conyers Jr., who faces allegations that he sexually harassed former employees, announced Tuesday that he will leave Congress immediately, and he endorsed his son, John Conyers III, to replace him. \n\n Mr. Conyers, the longest-serving current member of the House and the longest-serving African-American in history, called into a local radio show on Tuesday to break the news. \n\n \"I am retiring today,\" Mr. Conyers said from a hospital in Michigan. \"I am in the process of putting together my retirement plans. I will have more about that very soon.\" \n\n He continued to deny that he had harassed any of his former employees and said he did not know where the allegations came from. \n\n \"My legacy can’t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we are going through now,\" Mr. Conyers said. \"This too shall pass. My legacy will continue through my children.\" \n\n Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, also anounced Mr. Conyers’s retirement on the House floor Tuesday morning saying Mr. Conyers had informed Speaker Paul D. Ryan, and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, and Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan of his decision. \n\n The decision sets up a battle within the Conyers family for his Detroit-area House seat. Ian Conyers, a Michigan state senator and the grandson of Mr. Conyers’s brother, said he also plans to run for the seat held by his 88-year-old great-uncle. \n\n \"His doctor advised him that the rigor of another campaign would be too much for him just in terms of his health,\" Ian Conyers, 29, said. \n\n The congressman, who took his Michigan seat in the House in 1965, has already stepped aside as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee amid swirling allegations of sexual improprieties. He has been facing intense pressure to resign. \n\n Mr. Conyers, however, remained protective of his time in Congress. \"I am very proud of the fact that I am the dean of the Congress,\" he said, adding later that he appreciated the \"the incredible, undiminished support\" he had received from his state and the country as a whole. \n\n You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services. \n\n He also did not waver from his stance that he did nothing wrong and called the accusations against him false. \"Whatever they are, they are not accurate. They are not true,\" he said. \"I cannot explain where they came from. \n\n  Mr. Conyers also went on to say the allegations were just part of life as a lawmaker. \"This goes with the issue of politics, the game of politics which we are in,\" he said. \"We take what happens. We deal with it. We pass on and move on forward as we keep going trying to make as much as we can of this tremendous opportunity that has been given to me for so long.\" \n\n Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, had each said Mr. Conyers should resign after a woman who settled a sexual harassment claim against him said on television that the congressman had \"violated\" her body, repeatedly propositioned her for sex and asked her to touch his genitals. Other former staff members have since come forward to say he harassed them or behaved inappropriately. \n\n The younger Mr. Conyers said that despite the accusations, he believes Michigan voters will reward his family’s work in politics by electing him. \n\n The congressman \"still enjoys healthy support in our district,\" Mr. Conyers said. \n\n He added, \"People are ready to support our dean and to support our family as we continue to fight, as we have for leading up to a century, for people from Southeast Michigan.\" \n\n He said he believed his great-uncle should have due process but stopped short of defending him. \n\n \"I stand with my uncle in terms of his belief of no specific wrongdoing,\" Mr. Conyers said. \"However, those things need to have their day in court.\" \n\n The state senator, who has been in office for about a year, said he had planned to run for re-election next year for his current statehouse seat but would give up that race to run for his great-uncle’s seat in Washington. \n\n \"I’m absolutely going to file for his seat. The work of our congressional district, where I come out of, has to continue,\" he said. \"We have got to have someone who has depth and experience but also historical understanding of what it takes to fight this type of evil in Washington.\" \n\n The elder Mr. Conyers called into \"The Mildred Gaddis Show,\" a local radio program, to make the announcement. His decision comes as several other lawmakers face allegations of inappropriate behavior. \n\n Representative Joe Barton, a Republican and the Texas delegation’s most senior House member, announced this week in an interview with The Dallas Morning News that he would not seek re-election after sexually suggestive online messages that he sent to a constituent came to light. \n\n Representative Blake Farenthold, Republican of Texas, is also facing pressure after it was revealed last week that he used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment claim with his former communications director, Lauren Greene. She accused him of regularly making comments to gauge her interest in a sexual relationship, including saying he was having \"sexual fantasies\" about her.\n\n And last week, an Ohio Army veteran became the fifth woman to accuse Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, of inappropriate touching. Senior House Democrats have also begun calling for Mr. Franken to resign.",

            body: " Laquita Gardner, a sales manager at a furniture rental store here, was happy to get a raise recently except for one problem. It lifted her income just enough to disqualify her and her two young sons from Medicaid, the free health insurance program for the poor. \n\n She was relieved to find another option was available for the boys: the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, that covers nearly nine million children whose parents earn too much for Medicaid, but not enough to afford other coverage. \n\n But CHIP, a program that has had unusually strong bipartisan support since it was created in 1997, is now in limbo — an unexpected victim of the partisan rancor that has stymied legislative action in Washington this year. Its federal funds ran out on Sept. 30, and Congress has not agreed on a plan to renew the roughly $14 billion a year it spends on the program. \n\n \"I’m kind of shocked, because this is something for kids,\" Ms. Gardner said Thursday as her 7-year-old, Alexander, braced for a flu shot at a bright, busy neighborhood clinic run by the Nemours Children’s Health System. Ms. Gardner pays $25 a month for her sons’ CHIP coverage, with no deductible or co-payments. \n\n Congressional leaders may provide some temporary relief to a handful of states that expect to exhaust their CHIP funds before the end of this year. It would be tucked into a short-term spending bill intended to avert a government shutdown after Friday. Lawmakers from both parties hope to provide more money for CHIP in a separate, longer-term deal on federal spending. But Republicans will almost surely need Democratic votes to pass such legislation, and the antagonism between President Trump and Democrats in Congress is so great that no one can be sure of the outcome. \n\n Laquita Gardner, 29, relies on CHIP for coverage for her two sons. \"I’m kind of shocked, because this is something for kids,\" she said of its potential defunding. \n\n The uncertainty has been unsettling to parents, pediatricians and state officials around the country. States are weighing whether to freeze enrollment in CHIP, shut down their programs or find money from other sources. Last week Colorado sent letters to CHIP families, advising them to start researching private health insurance options because there was \"no guarantee\" that Congress would continue the program. Texas has drawn up a detailed \"termination timeline\" under which the state could begin mailing \n\n insurance cancellation notices on Dec. 22, three days before Christmas. \n\n \"It crushes me to think we’re in an environment where kids’ health is up for debate — that this somehow got tossed into the wrangling,\" said Dr. Todd Wolynn, a pediatrician in Pittsburgh and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics. \"There are kids on protocols and regimens and treatment plans, and their families have got to try to figure out, what are we going to do?\" \n\n Here in Delaware, health officials anticipate running out of money for CHIP at the end of January if Congress does not act. \n\n \"I’ve been around a while and I’ve never seen a program that is this popular, and that goes across the aisle,\" said Stephen Groff, director of the state’s Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance. \"To be having this discussion, that we may be in a funding crisis, is beyond belief.\" \n\n Members of both parties in the House and the Senate agree that Congress should provide money for CHIP for five years, through 2022. But they disagree over how to pay for it. \n\n In early November, the House passed a bill to extend the CHIP program. But most Democrats voted against it because the legislation would have cut funds for other public health programs and ended insurance coverage for several hundred thousand people who had failed to pay their share of premiums for insurance purchased under the Affordable Care Act. \n\n Dr. Jonathan Miller, chief of the Division of General Pediatrics at the Nemours Children’s Health System, attends to a checkup with Aiden Geary, 10. \n\n In the Senate, senior members of the Finance Committee say they have been making progress toward a bipartisan deal on CHIP, but they have been preoccupied for several weeks with their tax bill. \n\n As Congress dithered, Minnesota received an emergency infusion of federal funds to continue CHIP for October and November, but is expected to be the first state to run out of federal money for the program. Emily Piper, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, said the state would use its own funds to fill the gap temporarily. \n\n \"I don’t think Washington is working the way anyone in the country expects it to work right now,\" she said. \"A dysfunctional Washington has real consequences for people.\" \n\n Oregon, which expects to exhaust its federal CHIP funds this month, will also use state funds to continue coverage, said Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat. \"As Congress rebuffs its responsibilities, it is up to us, Oregonians, to stand up for our children,\" she said. \n\n Colorado was the first state to send warning letters to families with CHIP coverage. \"We felt it was important that folks covered by CHIP understand what’s happening,\" said Marc Williams, a spokesman for the state Department of Health Care Policy and Financing. \n\n In Texas, more than 450,000 children could lose CHIP coverage on Feb. 1 unless the state can obtain $90 million. Even if it comes through, supporters of the program worry about the effect of cancellation warnings. \n\n The Nemours Children’s Health System treats 15,000 children with CHIP coverage each year. \"It provides specialized care for children that’s more comprehensive than a lot of private coverage,\" Dr. Miller said, \"which is really designed with adults in mind.\" Credit Mark Makela for The New York Times\n\n \"It gets very, very complicated once the state sends those letters out and starts walking down that road,\" said Laura Guerra-Cardus, deputy director of the Children’s Defense Fund-Texas. \"It can really affect trust in the program. So many families still don’t realize this is coming, and the few I’ve informed, they go immediately into a state of alarm.\" \n\n Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is responsible for the program, said last week that \"we need to get CHIP done\" because \"states are in a real mess right now.\" \n\n Democrats said Congress should have provided money for CHIP months ago, but that Republicans had placed a higher priority on dismantling the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes. \n\n \"Because Congress failed to do its job — a bunch of elected officials who have insurance paid by taxpayers failed to do their job — children here in America are about to be kicked off of their health insurance,\" said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \n\n Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, insisted: \"We’re going to get CHIP through. There is no question about that.\" \n\n Mr. Hatch led efforts to create the program in collaboration with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, in 1997. \"Nobody believes in the CHIP program more than I,\" Mr. Hatch said on the Senate floor last week. \"I invented it.\" \n\n Olivia Carrow said three of her children were newly uninsured and she had heard they might qualify for CHIP. They had insurance through Ms. Carrow’s job as a nurse but lost it after she cut back her hours this fall. Her two-year-old, William, qualifies for Medicaid because of a serious condition that causes his trachea to collapse. Credit Mark Makela for The New York Time. \n\n Doctors at the Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, here in Wilmington, were continuing to see CHIP patients last week at the flagship of a system that treats 15,000 children with CHIP coverage each year. Dr. Jonathan Miller, chief of the system’s Division of General Pediatrics, said many receive therapy for developmental delays and treatment for chronic conditions like asthma and obesity. \n\n \"It provides specialized care for children that’s more comprehensive than a lot of private coverage,\" he said, \"which is really designed with adults in mind.\" \n\n  Research has also found CHIP increasingly helps people whose employer-provided insurance is too expensive for their entire family. Ariel Haughton, a mother of two in Pittsburgh, said it would cost more than $100 more a month to put her two children on the plan her husband gets through his job as an apprentice plumber, which also requires them to pay a high deductible before the coverage kicks in. Without CHIP, Ms. Haughton said, she might have delayed visiting the pediatrician this summer when her daughter had a fever and rash that turned out to be Lyme disease. \n\n \"It makes it so much easier for me to actually take good care of my children,\" said Ms. Haughton. \"We’ve had a rocky last few years, but at least I can take them to the doctor without having to be like, ‘Their fever isn’t 105 so I guess I’d better skip it.’\" \n\n Olivia Carrow, who had brought her 2-year-old to the children’s hospital here to test for an infection, said her other three children were newly uninsured and she had heard they might qualify for CHIP. The 2-year-old, William, qualifies for Medicaid because of a serious condition that causes his trachea to collapse. \n\n The rest of the family had insurance through Ms. Carrow’s job as a nurse, but lost it after she cut back her hours this fall. She and her husband started a chicken farm this year and delayed exploring other coverage options, she said, partly because of the protracted fight in Congress over proposals to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \n\n \"Not knowing how things are going to go — I feel that way about health coverage in general,\" Ms. Carrow said. \"It doesn’t surprise me, but it gets very sad.\" ",

            summary: "Patagonia, REI and other outdoor clothing and equipment retailers are speaking out against President Trump’s announced plan to shrink the monument by 85 percent.",
            body: "Patagonia, REI and other outdoor clothing and equipment retailers are speaking out against President Trump’s plan to slash the size of two national monuments in Utah by some two million acres. \n\n Mr. Trump on Monday announced that his administration would shrink Bears Ears National Monument, a region of red rock canyons, by 85 percent, and cut another monument, Grand Staircase-Escalante, to about half its current size. \n\n \"The president stole your land,\" Patagonia said in a pop-up message on its website. \"In an illegal move, the president just reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. This is the largest elimination of protected land in American history.\" \n\n REI said it would continue to pursue bipartisan support to protect public lands and \"prevent death by a thousand cuts.\" \n\n \"We just lost millions of acres of protected land,\" the company said. \"But we remain united as a community.\" \n\n North Face, citing federal lawsuits that were filed in anticipation of Mr. Trump’s decision, said it was donating $100,000 to an education center for Bears Ears. \n\n And the Canadian company Arc’teryx announced it would donate the net proceeds of its Nov. 28 post-Thanksgiving eCommerce sales in the United States to The Conservation Alliance and an additional $30,000 to the alliance’s Public Lands Defense Fund, which is challenging the legality of Mr. Trump’s move. \n\n You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services. \n\n Patagonia has been at the forefront of the outdoor recreation industry as the sector becomes increasingly politicized by the actions of President Trump this year. In January, L.L. Bean, the retailer known for its winter boots, faced a boycott from its liberal customers after Mr. Trump tweeted his thanks to a member of the Bean family who had donated to a political action committee that supported his presidential campaign. \n\n Mr. Trump announced his decision to reduce the public lands during a speech at Utah’s State Capitol in Salt Lake City, undoing the designations of his Democratic predecessors. President Barack Obama made Bears Ears a monument in 2016, and President Bill Clinton classified Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996, using the Antiquities Act, which allows presidents to set aside landmarks and \"other objects of historic or scientific interest.\" \n\n Rose Marcario, Patagonia’s president, has previously warned that the company would take legal action to protect public lands, particularly after Mr. Trump in April ordered the secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, to review 27 national monuments. In response to the president’s remarks on Monday, she said the company would \"continue that fight in the courts.\" \n\n Several lawsuits are expected to challenge the Bears Ears decision, including ones from tribes and conservation and outdoor industry groups. \n\n At least one lawsuit has already been filed, in District Court in Washington, D.C., on Monday — by the Wilderness Society, Great Old Broads for Wilderness and eight other groups — in defense of Grand Staircase. It named Mr. Trump, Mr. Zinke and Brian Steed, of the Bureau of Land Management, as defendants, saying Mr. Trump exceeded his authority under the Constitution and the Antiquities Act that established the monuments. \n\n The expected legal battle could alter the course of American land conservation, and usher in logging, mining and other commercial activities onto preserved public areas.
